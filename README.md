# Tetris (ncurses)
Rewrite in C soon.

The code is terrible, i probably wrote it while being very tired, in a rush, ill, and drunk. Check [this](https://github.com/dnl-ua/tetris) instead. I'm gonna keep it tho, to show people that even if you suck at the start, give it some time, and you'll still suck but a bit less.
